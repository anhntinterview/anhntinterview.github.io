- fix/hotfix:   A bug fix
- docs      :   Documentation only changes
- style     :   Changes that do not affect the meaning of code
                (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)

- perf      :   A code change that improves performance
- test      :   Adding missing tests      
- chores    :   Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation

- INIT      : Start ticket

- FN        : Ticket was finished but it does not be reviewed
- RV        : Ticket is being reviewed
- DONE      : Passed review code
- REMOVE    : branch/ticket was removed on repository

# Get start code step by step:
1. Create a branch name: git checkout -b <set_branch>
2. Format name of branch: <code_commit_convention_name>/<ticket_id>/<ticket_title>

Format a commit: "<phase_name>-<code_commit_convention_name>:<ticket_id>/<ticket_title>/<action_description>"
